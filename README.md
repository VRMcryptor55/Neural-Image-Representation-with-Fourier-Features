High-Frequency Image Component Modeling with a Fourier Feature MLP
This project engineers a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to overcome spectral bias, enabling the precise modeling of high-frequency components within images. By implementing a Fourier feature mapping technique, the model can learn and reconstruct intricate image textures with high fidelity.

üåü Key Achievements
Overcame Spectral Bias: Engineered a multilayer perceptron capable of precisely modeling high-frequency components within images, a common challenge for standard MLPs.

Fourier Feature Mapping: Implemented a Fourier feature mapping technique that transforms input coordinates, allowing the network to learn complex and intricate image textures.

Efficient Training: Leveraged the PyTorch framework and CUDA acceleration to construct and efficiently train the neural network, leading to rapid model convergence.

Superior Image Quality: Achieved a substantial leap in image reconstruction quality, evidenced by a significantly higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) compared to a standard MLP.

üîß How It Works
The core of the project is a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-like approach where a neural network learns a continuous representation of an image. The network is trained to map 2D pixel coordinates (x, y) to their corresponding RGB color values.

To overcome the spectral bias of standard MLPs, which struggle with high-frequency details, this project uses Fourier Feature Mapping. Before passing the coordinates to the network, they are transformed into a higher-dimensional feature space using sine and cosine functions of different frequencies. This positional encoding allows the model to capture fine details and sharp edges in the image much more effectively.

üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:

PyTorch

Matplotlib

NumPy

You can install them using pip:

Bash

pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy

üöÄ Usage
Prepare your image: Place your desired training image in the project directory and name it image.jpg.

Run the notebook: Open and execute the cells in the Experiment_6_21EC39051.ipynb notebook. The notebook is structured to:

Load and preprocess the image.

Train a standard MLP as a baseline.

Train the Fourier Feature MLP.

Evaluate and compare the results using PSNR.

Visualize the reconstructed images.

üìä Results
The Fourier Feature MLP is expected to demonstrate a significant improvement in image reconstruction quality over the standard MLP. This will be visible in the final generated image, which will be much sharper and more detailed, and will be quantitatively confirmed by a higher PSNR value. The notebook includes plots to visualize the training loss and the PSNR comparison between the models.
